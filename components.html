                    <p>Stay and dive at Twin Rocks

					The resort: I thought the place is well maintained. We booked the Regina suite (2 BR with one shared bath, kitchenette and living room). My main purpose was to check out the diving in Catanduanes. The rest of the family were there for some fun.

					Dining: we mostly dined at the resort restaurant as it was rainy. I thought the food was good -breakfast, lunch and dinner. We mail ate ;the loccal food. My only pet peeve is the coffee. I prefer brewed coffee but, I noticed that, in the provinces, they mainly use those pre-packaged coffee mix (which, to me, hardly tasted like coffee at all).

					Front desk and staffs: No complaints there. They are all very helpful and accommodating.

					Internet: As in all the province I'd been to, connections can be sporadic specially when it is rainy. There is WIF at the registration area and in the rooms or grounds. Again, it can be sporadic. We found that signal is better on the balcony of our room. However, there are times when signal is good even in the bedrooms. It may all depend on how many users and the weather conditions there.

					The diving: I did 4 dives with Dave of Catan Divers. They were reef dives; none or very mild current if at all.
					We did not dive the reefs at Twin Rocks due to poor visibility at the time. We took the banca and went out to 4 different dive sites. All dives were done early in the morning timing the tide. Dave picked me up at the resort at 0600 and we are on the boat by 0700. The dive boat can carry 2 divers without problem, but will be too crowded with more divers. Dave said he uses two dive boats if there are 4 or more divers. Donning BCD is in water. One puts on the weight belt, slide into the water and Dave and his crew assisted with the BCD/tank.

                    <p><b>PM me if there are questions about diving at Catanduanes. Dave's contact info is info@catandivers.com.</b></p>

                    <p>OH KEMJI
					Oh Kemji whats happenned !!
					Still refurbishing constant noise during the day. Room needs freshening up, dont like to see peeling paint etc and a smell in the air also
					on our stay the outside bar was closed so seating was very hard to find in the small cafe area. Food was ok but a little expensive, please always serve cutlery even with a burger. Small details matter so dont use toilet tissue inside the napkin dispenser
					Coffee is of the cheap packet variety famiiar to everyone who knows the Philippines, please use a proper barista type coffee and machine
					Unsure why baked beans were served cold on the English breakfastand more to the point they were very hard and horrible. remove them from the serving, same with the cucumber it has no place on an English Breakfast. Tomatoes should be served grilled or be on the tinned variety and served hot 
					Didn`t try the massage but prices were reasonable
					WIFI this time was very slow and poor
					Swimming time closure is 11pm far to late and very noisey
					Live Band was playing when we stayed also. be aware there is no escape from the noise until they have finished there set etc. which is late, not even to your room
					Staff very helpful as always”</p>

                    <p>Better than expected
					Quite a pleasant surprise for a hotel in this nice town. Looks very heavy from the outside with all the Roman pillars. In the inside, it's quite the same with heavy furniture and décor. The staff were super friendly and quick to check me in after the mandatory forms. The room was just right for one person.clean bed and toilet, running hot water..the room had a balcony which looked into the sea. What impressed was the meals. Enjoyed their dinner options. The hotel is not too far from town. Happy to have stayed here.”</p>

					I am satisfied with the overall service of the hotel.  The room was very clean and cozy. The food is great as well! Everyone is polite and accommodating. 

					I travel a lot and seldom experience overall satisfaction like this. Thank you for making my stay in Catanduanes memorable</p>
